Teven Jenkins started a career-high 14 games in his fourth season, finally fighting off the injury bug, and now it’s time to get paid. The run mauler has improved in pass protection since moving inside to left guard from right and left tackle. Though Caleb Williams was sacked an NFL-high 68 times in 2024, only four were attributed to Jenkins, whose pressure rate allowed (3.7 percent) is among the best in this class.

One day after agreeing to terms with the Seattle Seahawks, ex-Dallas Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence didn’t hold back his feelings about his former team.
In an interview Thursday with Brian Nemhauser of Hawk Blogger, Lawrence appeared to take a swipe at the Cowboys. After discussing the move to Seattle, Lawrence, who spent his first 11 NFL seasons in Dallas, said: “Dallas is my home. I made my home there, my family is there, and I’m forever gonna be there. But I know for sure I’m not going to win a Super Bowl there. So, yeah, we here.”
Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons fired back with more pointed words for the four-time Pro Bowler on X, writing: “This (is) what rejection and envy look like! This (is) some clown s—.”
Lawrence and Parsons exchanged posts on X until Lawrence, determined to win the back-and-forth escalation, posted one final message: “Maybe if you spent less time tweeting and more time winning, I wouldn’t have left.”

Mekhi Becton’s 2024 season was a wonderful success story. He hit the market last spring as an inconsistent, injury-prone offensive tackle, ranking 92nd on this list. The Eagles signed him for $2.75 million to play guard, and he thrived next to a potential Hall of Fame right tackle (Lane Johnson) and under an acclaimed OL coach (Jeff Stoutland), having a career season and earning a major raise. Becton has spoken highly of the Eagles, and perhaps he’ll take less to stay in Philadelphia, but history suggests Howie Roseman is more likely to look for the next Becton than pay him at his peak value. Becton is a mauler in the run game, but he still has issues as a pass blocker: 
His 6.0 percent pressure rate allowed ranked 55th among guards (minimum 200 pass blocking snaps) in 2024. Given all of these dynamics (and his lengthy injury history), Becton’s market is a bit unpredictable.

The Bills have agreed to terms with CB Dane Jackson on a one-year deal, according to a league source.
After one year away, Jackson is back. And as things stand today, he's the CB2.

New York Giants brass has been broadcasting for months that the blame for the disastrous 2024 season belonged to the team’s quarterback play. Whether it was general manager Joe Schoen emphasizing how the 2-8 Giants weren’t “far off” at his bye-week news conference just before Daniel Jones was benched, or if it was coach Brian Daboll crowing after a Week 17 win about how “good quarterback play” would give the team a chance in every game after their lone victory in their final 12 games, the message has been clear.
Surely, the same notion was conveyed to John Mara when Schoen and Daboll met with the co-owner two days before the season finale and made their case to survive the worst season in the franchise’s 100-year history.
“I think once you solve the quarterback issue, I think a lot of these other things will improve as well,” Mara said days after that meeting while explaining his decision to retain the duo.
The early stages of the Giants’ offseason have amplified their words. Forget the aggressive pursuit of Matthew Stafford, or the ongoing dance with Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson. The non-quarterback moves the Giants have made in the first week of free agency illustrate what they view as the culprit for last season’s 31st-ranked offense.

With two moves, the Chargers took their first steps toward replacing defensive lineman Poona Ford. General manager Joe Hortiz and coach Jim Harbaugh were forced to pivot after Ford agreed to a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams on Monday. The Chargers agreed to terms with two interior defensive linemen Thursday to add some needed bodies to the room.
The Chargers first agreed to terms with former Miami Dolphins defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand. That deal is for one year and up to $3.35 million, according to a league source. The Chargers then agreed to terms with former Arizona Cardinals defensive lineman Naquan Jones. That deal is for one year, according to Jones’ agent. I am projecting that as a veteran minimum contract for $1.17 million.
Hand, 29, was drafted in the fourth round by the Detroit Lions in 2018 out of Alabama. He battled injuries in the early stages of his career, landing on injured reserve in each of his first five seasons, which also included stops with the Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans. In Miami, Hand was able to stay on the field and resurrect his career. He played 16 games in 2023. And in 2024, he played a career-high 563 snaps and played in all 17 games.

While the San Francisco 49ers recently lost two prominent offensive weapons in Deebo Samuel and Kyle Juszczyk, it still has considerable talent on that side of the ball in Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle, Brock Purdy and, once he’s healthy again, Brandon Aiyuk.
On defense, the changes were more severe. They said goodbye this week to three defensive line starters — Floyd, Maliek Collins and Javon Hargrave — starting linebacker Dre Greenlaw, and two key members of the secondary in cornerback Charvarius Ward and safety Talanoa Hufanga.
San Francisco believes it can depend on its own “weight-bearing walls” while it restocks the defensive cupboard. That group includes McCaffrey, Kittle and Brock Purdy on offense and Nick Bosa, Fred Warner and Deommodore Lenoir on defense.
The 49ers likely are confident in their plan because they’ve seen it work for their division rival, the Los Angeles Rams.

Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett is speaking to the media in his first news conference since signing a new historic contract. 
Garrett on what changed that led to staying in Cleveland: 
"Just having constant communication with the team...just talking about the plans and how we can turn this team into a winner," Garrett said.
"From day 1 I've always said I wanted to bring a championship to Northeast Ohio."

The Detroit Lions are re-signing wide receiver Tim Patrick, the team announced today. Patrick had 33 receptions last season for 394 receiving yards and three touchdowns.
Getty Images 
Chicago Bears offensive guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson both mentioned the number 40 — specifically, the Lions’ ability to put up 40 points in Ben Johnson’s offense.
“You’ve seen the offenses he’s had, and like I said earlier, the 40-plus point capabilities it brings to the table,” said Jackson, who played for Detroit from 2020 to 2023. “He’s a winner. That’s what he wants to do.”
Thuney played with Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes. It probably takes a lot for an offense to impress him.
“Watching Detroit’s offense over the years, every week it’s 30, 40 points with really great, creative plays,” he said. “It’s just an offense you wanna be a part of.”
As the new offensive linemen walked into Halas Hall for the first time, they might not know how rare it is around these parts for the home team to score 40.

Building through free agency can hurt a team in the long term, depending on the types of deals that are given, but there’s plenty of evidence that it can help in the short term. So let’s be short-sighted today and look at the teams that have improved specific units on their teams the most after the early portion of the offseason (trades count, too), while considering scheme/team fits.

It was a wild start to NFL free agency, as the usual flurry of impact signings (and re-signings) shared headlines with several intriguing trades.
Plenty of free agents remain unsigned, but with the first wave of moves out of the way, let’s turn our attention back to the 2025 NFL Draft. How has all that’s happened early in the offseason impacted what we can expect come April?

The Washington Commanders’ roster is coming together.
Wednesday marked the official start of the new league year, though every team began negotiating during Monday’s legal tampering period. Of course, there was no dead period with re-signing your free agents, and the 2024 NFC finalists hammered out deals in that window. It’s the same for trades.
The Commanders took bold action to help the offense. As for the defense, let’s call that a work in progress. Overall, Washington made moves involving a staggering 24 players through Thursday, headlined by trades for left tackle Laremy Tunsil and wide receiver Deebo Samuel, which cost the team a net of four draft picks. Tunsil and Samuel are the only two of eight newcomers who play offense. That side of the ball is upgraded, which is saying something for the fifth-highest scoring team last season.
Bolstering quarterback Jayden Daniels this way is logical. Acquiring Tunsil, a five-time Pro Bowler and elite pass protector, will take pressure off Daniels. That’s literally in terms of keeping blindside pass rushers off the Offensive Rookie of the Year, and figuratively. Sometimes, it was evident that Daniels felt extra responsibility, even if his demeanor never showed it.

## 2. When is senate voting on 2025 budget? What would governement shutdown mean? Latest news, updates

🔗 **Source:** https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/14/will-government-shutdown-march-2025-update-today-what-is-us-federal-govt-shutdown-when-senate-vote/82400328007/

Donald Trump and the U.S. House of Representatives await a vote by the U.S. Senate that will decide if a government shutdown will go into effect.
Here's what we know about the U.S. Senate vote and a potential government shutdown:
The 2025 government shutdown deadline is 11:59 p.m. ET on Friday, March 14, 2025. A shutdown would go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday if a funding bill is not passed and signed by Trump by the end of the day.
The U.S. Senate stand adjourned until 10 a.m. ET Friday, March 14, 2025. Discussions around a vote will resume when the Senate reconvenes.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) confirmed Thursday he would vote for the Republican government funding by the end of today.
"While the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse. I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country to minimize the harms to the American people. Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down," Schumer said during a speech on the Senate floor.
Here's what would happen if a 2025 government shutdown were to occur:
The last government shutdown began Dec. 22, 2018, and ended on Jan. 25, 2019. This shutdown marked the third government shutdown during Trump's first term as president, according to USA Today.
The longest government shutdown was also the most recent shutdown lasting 35 days in 2018-19 for the third time during Trump's first term as president, according to USA Today. Nearly 800,000 government employees were left without pay for more than a month.
Yes, disability and retirement benefits proceed without interruptions.
Employees deemed "non-essential" do not get paid during a government shutdown and "essential" employees who may be called upon to continue to work may not get paid until the shutdown is resolved.
Kentucky has 22,079 federal civilian employees with an average salary of $82,140, according U.S. Census and U.S. Office of Personnel Management data. These workers would be subjected to furloughs.

## 3. Live updates: Senate works to avert partial government shutdown ahead of midnight deadline

🔗 **Source:** https://apnews.com/live/donald-trump-news-updates-3-14-2025

As a shutdown deadline looms, Senate Democrats are mounting a last-ditch protest over a Republican-led spending bill that already passed the House which they argue gives President Donald Trump too much discretion on spending decisions.
The Senate finds itself in a familiar position, working to avoid a partial government shutdown with just hours to spare Friday. Democrats are confronting two painful options: allowing passage of a bill they believe gives President Donald Trump vast discretion on spending decisions or voting no and letting a funding lapse ensue.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but late Thursday made clear he will not allow a government shutdown. His move gives Democrats room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to come up for a vote.
Other news we’re following today:

Sixty-six House Democrats from a diverse regional and ideological cross section of the party sent a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to express “strong opposition” to any Senate Democrats backing the Republican continuing resolution.
Freshman Rep. Derek Tran of California spearheaded the letter, but sources close to the process say that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, blessed sending the letter to Schumer.
“The American people sent Democrats to Congress to fight against Republican dysfunction and chaos,” the letter reads. “Instead of capitulating to their obstruction, we must fight for a regular (2025 fiscal year) appropriations measure that reflects our nation’s values to provide uninterrupted access to lifesaving government services.”
The vice president toured a plastics facility in Bay City, Michigan and promised “a great American comeback” in manufacturing — even as he urged patience for it to fully materialize.
“The road ahead of us is long,” Vance told the crowd of about 100 people at Vantage Plastics. 
The Trump administration’s tariffs on Canada has especially concerned some businesses in the border state, but Vance defended them as a way to increase domestic manufacturing.
“If you want to be penalized, build outside of America,” he said.
Immigration officials have arrested a second person who participated in Pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, and have revoked the visa of another student, they announced Friday.
Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested by immigration officers for overstaying her student visa, the Department of Homeland Security said. Kordia’s visa was terminated in January 2022 for “lack of attendance,” the department said. Kordia was previously arrested for her involvement in protests at Columbia in April 2024, it added.
The Trump administration also revoked the visa of Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and doctoral student, on March 5 “for advocating for violence and terrorism.” On Tuesday, Srinivasan opted to “self-deport,” the department said.
The announcement comes after the recent arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who helped lead student protests at the school and is facing deportation.

Rubio was speaking to reporters Friday after talks in Moscow between a U.S. envoy and Putin ended with no word of an agreement on a ceasefire with Ukraine.
“We will get there,” Rubio said. “We’re certainly at least talking about peace for the first time in three years.”
Rubio says Trump’s repeated calls for Canada to become the 51st state began with a chat the president had with former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Rubio said Trudeau told Trump that Canada “couldn’t survive as a nation-state” if the U.S. went ahead with threatened tariffs on Canadian imports.
“At which point the president said, well, then you should become a state. And that’s where this began,” Rubio told reporters. 
Trump “loves Canada,” Rubio insisted. He simply “made an argument for why Canada would be better off joining the United States from an economic perspective and the like. He’s made that argument repeatedly, and I think it stands for itself.”

Former Department of Education press secretary Dorie Nolt speaks at a protest following staffing cuts at the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., Friday, March 14, 2025. 
Ringing cowbells and chanting, organizers, teachers, former employees and locals gathered in Washington to protest personnel cuts in the Department of Education on Friday morning. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii joined teachers’ union representatives and advocacy organizations to speak at the event. Dozens of cars and trucks, along with tour buses and a Metro bus, honked in support of the line of protesters along Independence Avenue.
“This isn’t just about a department and a building, this is about federal streams of money that help students live into their full potential,” said Kim Anderson, National Education Association executive director. “This agenda is about cutting funding and shipping it to public schools.”
The Education Department plans to lay off more than 1,300 of its employees as part of an effort to halve the organization’s staff — a prelude to Trump’s plan to dismantle the agency.
It comes after the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a well-known Palestinian activist now detained in Louisiana over his role in protests at Columbia University against the war in Gaza. Khalil is a legal U.S. permanent resident with no criminal history and a pregnant American citizen wife.
Rubio said they’ll keep looking for people with student visas who wouldn’t have been let into the country by the Trump administration “had we known they were going to do what they’ve done.”
“But now that they’ve done it, we’re going to get rid of them,” Rubio said.
Rubio said Friday he’s “cautiously optimistic” about Russian President Vladimir Putin agreeing to a cease-fire with Ukraine after Putin’s meeting with a U.S. envoy on the war.
Trump administration officials plan to spend the weekend debriefing presidential envoy Steve Witkoff on his session with Putin and on next steps, Rubio said. Rubio spoke to reporters at the end of a Group of Seven meeting in Canada.
The talks with Putin did not appear to secure the immediate agreement for a ceasefire that Rubio had said Americans would press Putin for. Still, he said “we certainly feel like we’re at least some steps closer to ending this war.”
Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, NV: She said she’s “still weighing the impact” of her vote.
Sen. Maria Cantwell, WA: “It’s so important for my state to have infrastructure investment. They’re cutting 40% out of the Army Corps of Engineers. The lifeblood of my state is growing agriculture product and getting it to destinations all around the globe.” She said she’d vote no on the continuing resolution.
Sen. Tina Smith, MN: “I’m voting no on the CR. I believe that the CR would do terrible damage. It’s not even a CR. It’s a it’s a new bill written exclusively by Republicans that would do great damage to Minnesota.”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, RI: “The real danger here is this Trump-Musk cabal that is out to break government, destroy agencies, fire off thousands of people, ruined government services. Also they can give data probably and tax breaks to billionaires.” He said he’d vote no on the resolution.
Sen. Ben Lujan, NM: “Colleagues are having to make those decisions. If you’re ask if I support Chuck Schumer, I support Chuck Schumer. And, I announced I’ll be voting no. And I’m, right now, that’s where I’m standing.”
Marco Rubio says the Trump administration’s tariffs are about making trade fair.
He told reporters Friday after the Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting in Canada that Trump wants to “charge other countries what they charge us.”
Rubio acknowledged that those benefiting from previous arrangements likely do “feel it is hostile to change the status quo.” 
But he said “This is not meant as a hostile move against Japan or Germany or anybody else. This is about balancing and fairness and trade.”
Tariffs and other Trump policies overshadowed the meeting of G7 allies, but they were able to find consensus on peace in Ukraine and other topics.
In a scathing rebuke to Senate leadership, the House Speaker Emerita said Trump and Musk are offering a false choice between the bill and a shutdown.
Instead Rep. Nancy Pelosi is imploring Senate Democrats to “listen to the women” — top Democratic appropriators Sen. Patty Murry and Sen. Rosa DeLauro — and fight in favor of their 30-day stopgap plan. “We must fight back for a better way,” she said.
Notably, Pelosi’s statement mentions Trump’s first-term shutdown, which was the longest in history when Democrats refused to provide funding for his promised U.S-Mexico border wall.
“America has experienced a Trump shutdown before — but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse,” Pelosi said.
“There’s always going to be an election cycle. This is not about politics. This is about what is best for the American people. We made that vote with that interest in mind,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the Democratic caucus chair.
Aguilar reiterated that House Democrats feel that supporting the bill makes lawmakers “complicit” in Trump’s agenda. But he said “we have all the respect in the world for our Senate colleagues” — a message they’re sharing while lobbying them on the phone.
“This has really been about what are our tactics and strategies to defending Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, from what Donald Trump and Elon Musk are seeking to do each every day,” he said.

Carney, a former Goldman Sachs executive with no experience in politics, becomes Canada’s 24th prime minister, and will now try to steer his country through Trump’s trade war.
Carney has said he’s ready to meet with Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take ”a common approach, a much more comprehensive approach for trade.″
Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada’s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products April 2. He has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.

The billionaire’s meeting with the leader of the National Security Agency suggests his push to slash spending and personnel may soon focus on the nation’s intelligence community.
The agency said Friday that Musk met Wednesday with Gen. Timothy Haugh, who directs the NSA as well as U.S. Cyber Command, which coordinates the Pentagon’s cybersecurity work.
An NSA statement said the meeting was intended to ensure both organizations are “aligned” with the new administration’s priorities.
Like the CIA, the NSA has offered buyouts to personnel as Trump and Musk push deep cuts to the federal workforce.
Tesla warned a top Trump trade official that retaliatory tariffs could add to the costs of its cars sold abroad.
“U.S. exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to U.S. trade actions,” Tesla wrote this week in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, first reported by the Financial Times. 
The carefully worded letter expresses support for Trump’s “fair trade” efforts while also aligning with most economists who say tariffs do more harm than good. The retaliation by China, Canada and Europe comes as Tesla’s sales plunge overseas amid competition by foreign EV makers and calls for boycotts.
Tesla’s stock rocketed after Trump’s election, but it has plummeted 50% since its mid-December high, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth.
Their federal lawsuit filed in Rhode Island argues that Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order freezing billions of dollars already approved by Congress is arbitrary and capricious, lacks statutory authority and violates the Administrative Procedure Act.
Americans are being harmed, they say, by the freeze on weatherization programs, programs aimed at reducing food waste and work to protect giant sequoias and other large trees.
The suit by the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, National Council of Nonprofits, Eastern Rhode Island Conservation District and Green Infrastructure Center demands the resumption of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act as well as Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

Addressing reporters outside the White House, Karoline Leavitt said Trump’s afternoon speech at the Department of Justice also will focus “on restoring law and order to our country.”
She accused the Biden administration of creating a DOJ that she said “was weaponized against Americans for their political ideologies.”
She said Trump will be joined by relatives of people who died due to fentanyl overdoses and by “angel moms,” whose children were killed in violence involving people in the country illegally.
The license allowed U.S. firms to do business with Russian energy companies through sanctioned Russian banks. 
A Treasury Department representative confirmed the expiration. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, telling The Associated Press that the Trump administration is focused on fostering negotiations to end the war.
The expiration of the license, which was issued during Joe Biden’s presidency, adds pressure on Russia to accept a ceasefire deal crafted by the U.S., which Ukraine has accepted.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said the Trump administration would go “all in” on Russia sanctions in order to end the war raging since February 2022.
For the second day, Sen. Markwayne Mullin is presiding over the Senate chamber in a tan cowboy hat, pushing the limits of rules for attire in the Senate chamber.

Exactly what senators can and cannot wear when they enter the chamber has evolved over the years, and it has recently come up as some lawmakers go casual: 
Facing a groundswell of Democratic dissent, Schumer insists that voting for the Republican funding bill is better than a federal shutdown, which he says would give Trump and Musk free rein to gut the government.
“A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,” Schumer warned as the Senate opened.
Schumer said Democrats are not backing down and vowed a long-term fight against the Trump agenda.

A Senate Finance Committee hearing has begun for Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
The 64-year-old Oz was a respected heart surgeon who became a popular TV pitchman. Now Trump wants him to oversee health insurance for about 150 million Americans.
Republicans likely will ask Oz how he’ll trim fraud from Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats will probably focus on cuts he would make to insurance coverage and his televised comments supporting privatized Medicare.

John Thune says the chamber is ready to vote later in the day, and he’s “hopeful that enough Democrats will reject their party’s threat of shutting down the government to get this bill passed today.”
With a 53-47 majority, and some dissent within his won Republican ranks, the GOP leader still needs at least eight Democrats to cross party lines to clear the 60-vote threshold.

The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment measure has fallen for three straight months and is down 22% from December 2024.
Declining confidence showed up “consistently across all groups by age, education, income, wealth, political affiliations, and geographic regions,” survey director Joanne Hsu said.
“Many consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors; frequent gyrations in economic policies make it very difficult for consumers to plan for the future, regardless of one’s policy preference,” Hsu’s statement said.
Sentiment collapsed by more than a third among Democrats since December, nearly 20% among independents, and only slightly among Republicans. But a measure of Republicans’ economic outlook dropped by 10% just this month.

The Education Department announced the new investigations Friday, one month after issuing a memo warning America’s schools and colleges that they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences” in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life.
“Students must be assessed according to merit and accomplishment, not prejudged by the color of their skin,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. “We will not yield on this commitment.”
Most of the new inquiries are focused on colleges’ partnerships with the PhD Project, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented groups get degrees in business with the goal of diversifying the business world.
Department officials said that the group limits eligibility based on race and that colleges that partner with it are “engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs.”
The group of 45 colleges facing scrutiny over ties to the PhD Project include major public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and Rutgers, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Cornell, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries reiterated that House Democrats would not be “complicit” in the GOP spending plan.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York expressed frustration that Democratic senators aren’t aligning with the members “who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territories in the United States, who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people.” 
“There’s still time,” said Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico at a press conference of the Democratic Women’s Caucus. “The American people are shouting: Please do not hand the keys over to Elon Musk.”

The U.S. and Israel have reached out to officials from three East African governments to discuss using their territories as potential destinations to resettle more than 2 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. 
That’s according to American and Israeli officials who spoke to The Associated Press. The contacts were with Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland. 
The idea of a mass transfer of Palestinians was once considered a fantasy of Israel’s ultranationalist fringe, but since Trump presented the idea at a White House meeting last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hailed it as a “bold vision.”

The Group of 7 talks in Canada have been overshadowed by Trump’s trade and foreign policies and his repeated taunts aimed at the host. Top diplomats hope to reach consensus nevertheless on a final communique after hours of late-night negotiations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said “there is a great deal of unity within the G7,” pointing to support for the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. 
And she said Canada will be working on off-ramps from Trump’s trade war, even as it puts “maximum pressure” on their neighbor. “The Trump tariffs are going to hurt Americans. That’s our message, that’s our approach,” she said.

Schumer is winning praise from an unlikely source: Trump
“Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing — Took “guts” and courage!” the president posted on his social media account.
Just a day ago Trump was gearing up to blame Democrats for any government shutdown. Now he’s saying, “We should all work together.”

Federal agencies will begin to vacate hundreds of offices across the country this summer under a frenetic and error-riddled push by Elon Musk’s budget-cutting advisers to terminate leases that they say waste money.
Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency maintains a list of canceled real estate leases on its website, but internal documents obtained by The Associated Press contain a crucial detail: when those cancellations are expected to take effect. The documents from inside the General Services Administration, the U.S. government’s real estate manager, list dozens of federal office and building leases expected to end by June 30, with hundreds more slated over the coming months.
The rapid pace of cancellations has raised alarms, with some agencies and lawmakers appealing to DOGE to exempt specific buildings. Several agencies are facing 20 or more lease cancellations in all, including the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.

Democrats have been critical of the funding levels in the bill. They note that both defense and non-defense spending is lower than what was agreed to nearly two years ago when Congress passed legislation lifting the debt ceiling in return for spending restraints.
But they are even more worried about the discretion the bill gives the Trump administration on spending decisions. Many Democrats are referring to the measure as a “blank check” for Trump.
Spending bills typically come with specific funding directives for key programs, but hundreds of those directives fall away under the continuing resolution passed by the House. So the administration will have more leeway to decide where the money goes.
A day before a shutdown deadline, Senate Democrats are mounting a last-ditch protest over a Republican-led spending bill that already passed the House.
Democrats also object to:
Congress has been unable to pass the annual appropriations bills designed to fund the government, so they’ve resorted to passing short-term extensions instead. The legislation before the Senate marks the third such continuing resolution for the current fiscal year, now nearly half over.
The legislation would fund the federal government through the end of September. It would trim non-defense spending by about $13 billion from the previous year and increase defense spending by about $6 billion, which are marginal changes when talking about a topline spending level of nearly $1.7 trillion.
The Republican-led House passed the spending bill on Tuesday and then adjourned. The move left senators with a decision to either take it or leave it. And while Democrats have been pushing for a vote on a fourth short-term extension, GOP leadership made clear that option was a non-starter.
A procedural vote Friday will provide a first test of whether the package has the 60 votes needed to advance, ahead of final voting likely later in the day. At least eight Democrats will need to join with Republicans to move the funding package forward.

Trump is expected to use his visit to deliver a speech outlining his administration’s tough-on-crime agenda. But the appearance doubles as a victory lap after he emerged legally and politically unscathed from two federal prosecutions that were dismissed after his election win last fall.
The visit is the first by Trump and the first by any president in a decade. It brings Trump into the belly of an institution he has disparaged in searing terms for years but one that he has sought to reshape by installing loyalists and members of his personal defense team in top leadership positions.

Two federal judges handed down orders on Thursday requiring Trump’s administration to rehire thousands, if not tens of thousands, of probationary workers let go in mass firings across multiple agencies, slowing down for now the president’s dramatic downsizing of the federal government.
Both judges separately found legal problems with the way the mass terminations were carried out and ordered the employees at least temporarily brought back on the job.
The Trump administration has already appealed the first ruling. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt cast it as an attempt to encroach on the president’s power to hire and fire employees. “The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,” she said in a statement.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gave members of his caucus days to vent their frustration about the options before them, but late Thursday made clear he will not allow a government shutdown. His move gives Democrats room to side with Republicans and allow the continuing resolution, often described as a CR, to come up for a vote as soon as Friday.
A procedural vote Friday will provide a first test of whether the package has the 60 votes needed to advance, ahead of final voting likely later in the day. At least eight Democrats will need to join with Republicans to move the funding package forward.

🔗 **Source:** https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-presidency-03-13-2025/index.html


• Shutdown update: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that he will vote to keep the government open, signaling that there is a viable path to avoid a shutdown. He declined to say whether there will be enough other Democratic votes to advance the GOP funding bill.
    

            • Federal workers: Two federal judges ruled that thousands of probationary employees laid off en masse by the Trump administration must be temporarily reinstated to their jobs. The employees were fired as part of the administration’s effort to shrink the workforce.
    

• Appeal to SCOTUS: President Donald Trump’s administration asked the Supreme Court in a series of emergency appeals to allow him to move forward with plans to end birthright citizenship, elevating a fringe legal theory that several lower courts have resoundingly rejected.
    

• Trade war: US stocks slid and the S&P 500 closed down more than 10% from its record high in February as Trump threatened new tariffs on the EU. In Washington, DC, Canadian officials said they would meet again with their US counterparts to discuss the trade war and other issues.
    

Our live coverage of Donald Trump’s presidency has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates here.


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer defended his decision to back down on opposing the GOP’s government funding bill, warning Thursday evening that “every part of the government” would be at the Trump administration’s “wicked disposal” if the government were to shut down.
    

        “Every program, every part of government would be at their disposal, their wicked disposal,” he said on MSNBC. “So that’s the problem here. It’s not that the (continuing resolution) is good, it’s horrible. And all things being equal, we should have opposed it. But the alternative being a shutdown makes things worse.”
    



            Schumer said the Trump administration was continuing on with its agenda regardless of whether Democrats vote against their funding bill.
    

            “Look, they’re already, even without this CR, they’re already doing it,” he said. “And we have to look just a month ahead and see how bad a shutdown would be for all the things we believe in.”
    

            Vice President JD Vance deflected Thursday when asked if he could rule out the possibility of a recession, saying in part “you never can predict the future.”
    

        “Well, look, I think you never can predict the future, but I think the economy, the fundamentals of the economy, are actually quite strong right now,” the vice president said in an interview on Fox News.
    



Some context: Fears of a severe economic downturn have escalated in recent weeks. US stocks plunged earlier this week after President Donald Trump said he wouldn’t rule out a recession. Goldman Sachs has increased its chances of a recession in the next year to one-in-five, and former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN on Monday there is a “real possibility” of a recession caused by massive uncertainty over Trump’s policy.
    

            Trump’s aides have downplayed recession fears, suggesting instead that new tariffs will cause momentary “disruption” as global trade is realigned toward the United States.
    

            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday defended Trump’s tariffs as a necessary measure to save the US economy.
    

            “Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people,” she said, arguing that tariffs are needed to bring production back to the United States and punish countries that have taken advantage of the US in the past.
    

            Economists have warned the burden of tariffs could ultimately fall on American consumers.
    

            A second federal judge ruled Thursday that thousands of probationary employees laid off en masse by the Trump administration must be temporarily reinstated to their jobs.
    

            The new temporary restraining order from Senior Judge James Bredar covers 18 agencies and will last two weeks, as a challenge to the terminations from Democratic state attorneys general moves forward.
    

            It comes after a federal judge presiding over a separate lawsuit in California reversed mass layoffs of probationary workers among a smaller list of agencies earlier Thursday, though Bredar’s legal reasoning for reinstating the employees differs from that of the California judge, Judge William Alsup.

            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declined to say if there will be enough Democratic votes to advance the House-passed GOP funding bill tomorrow, shortly after he announced he would vote to avert a shutdown.
    

        “Members are making their own decisions right now,” he said tonight. “It’s not an easy decision. I think that people in my caucus have made their — are making their decisions, and I made mine,” he added.
    



            Yesterday, Schumer went to the floor and declared that Republicans would not have the votes to advance their funding bill, and said that Democrats were united behind a shorter, stop gap funding bill. Pressed on how he would respond to Democratic voters who will be disappointed that he is are caving, Schumer defended his decision.
    

            “Well, look, the bottom line is, you have to make these decisions based on what is best for not only your party but your country. And I firmly believe and always have that I’ve made the right decision,” he said.
    

The next steps: The New York senator said that they are still negotiating a time agreement and possible amendment votes, and that an amendment vote for Democrats’ one-month funding bill is still on the table.
    

            “We have to work that out with Thune, but that would be our preference, yes,” he said, referring to the GOP Majority Leader John Thune.
    

            Schumer also said that he spoke in the last few hours with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who opposed the GOP-led funding bill.
    

            North Carolina Rep. Chuck Edwards held a town hall tonight in Asheville where he was met with anger and yelling as the crowd pressed him about cuts to the federal government made by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 


            Some of the loudest boos for the Republican congressman came when he complimented DOGE leader Elon Musk.
    

Here are some crowd responses:


“I’m a veteran and you don’t give a f**k about me,” said an attendee, moments before four deputies escorted him out of the room at Edwards’ request. The shouting happened after Edwards’ comments about voting for the House budget resolution.
    

“Why are people losing their jobs at record numbers with no research?” one woman asked directly to Edwards in protest of federal workers losing their jobs.
    

“Tell us five things you’ve done this week,” someone asked, prompting laughter and a standing ovation among the crowd. The question is a play on Musk’s email sent to federal workers in late February asking them to explain what work they accomplished the previous week.
    

Edwards was also asked about US support for Ukraine. Here’s what was discussed:


On Russian President Vladimir Putin: “I believe the president recognizes that Putin is a murderous dictator,” Edwards said when asked if he supports Ukraine, given his backing for President Donald Trump.
    

            The US president however last month declined to refer to the Kremlin leader as a dictator, something he falsely called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    

On supporting Trump: “Why do you support a president who cares nothing about NATO, Ukraine and democracy but cares about Putin and other dictators?” an attendee asked and got a standing ovation from the crowd.
    

On funding Ukraine: Another attendee later asked the congressman if he will “stand up for Ukraine funding and protection?” The congressman said he voted that way. “I spent nine days in Ukraine,” he said, adding that he witnessed bombings. “I came back committed that we cannot stand idly by and watch the type of evil taking place like we see it taking place over there,” he said, which prompted applause from the crowd.

            Canada’s finance minister said his delegation had a “lengthy and frankly a big meeting” with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and his team today in Washington, DC.
    

            Dominic LeBlanc told reporters the US “agreed to maintain the dialogue” on trade tensions in the coming weeks.
    

        “I speak to Secretary Lutnick, in many cases, a number of times a week,” LeBlanc said. “We exchange text messages. He seems to be working late at night and early in the morning, and we agreed to continue those conversations.”
    



            LeBlanc said that any discussion on Canada’s over 200% tariff on US dairy did not come up. While the tariff has been a target of consternation from President Donald Trump, it only kicks in after the US reaches a specific quota of tariff-free dairy exports to Canada – a figure the US hasn’t reached due to Canada’s measures to protect domestic dairy production.
    

            Ottawa levied retaliatory tariffs on the US after Trump imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imported into the United States. Canada also targeted billions of dollars worth of imports from the US of computers, sporting equipment and cast iron products.
    

Here’s what others said about the meeting.


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this evening that he will vote to keep the government open, signaling that there is a viable path ahead to avoid a government shutdown tomorrow.
    

        “I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country to minimize the harms to the American people. Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down,” he said during a floor speech.
    



            The Democratic leader slammed Republicans for insisting on their bill to fund the government until September and said that Democrats are being faced with the choice of accepting a package they despise or allowing a shutdown.
    

            “This, in my view, is no choice at all. While the CR bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse,” Schumer said, referring to the GOP’s stopgap bill, known as a continuing resolution.
    

            Schumer echoed arguments that other Senate Democrats have made in the past several days, warning that a shutdown would allow President Donald Trump and DOGE more leeway for federal cuts.
    

            US Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has signed an agreement to allow the Department of Government Efficiency and the General Services Administration to work with the US Postal Service.
    

            According to a letter DeJoy sent to Congress today, DOGE teams will “assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.” The Elon Musk-led agency will focus on improving the management of USPS retirement assets and the Workers’ Compensation Program, as well as addressing the agency’s legislative mandates and regulatory requirements, the letter said.
    

        “The DOGE team was gracious enough to ask for the big problems they can help us with,” DeJoy wrote in the letter. “It has long been known that the Postal Service has a broken business model that was not financially sustainable without critically necessary and fundamental core change.”
    



            The Postal Service has already cut roughly 30,000 employees from its workforce since 2021, and plans to slash another 10,000 people in the next 30 days through a Voluntary Early Retirement program, DeJoy said in the letter. The agency currently employs approximately 635,000 workers across the US.

            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told Democrats at a private lunch meeting this afternoon that he will vote yes on tomorrow’s procedural vote to advance the GOP government funding bill, according to two Democrats familiar with the discussions.
    

            Schumer’s support for the GOP procedural step indicates that enough Senate Democrats will vote with Republicans to advance the House-passed bill and avert a shutdown at midnight.
    

            The New York Democratic leader had said a day earlier that Republicans did not have the votes to advance the bill.
    

What the Republican leader is saying: Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he hasn’t spoken to Schumer since Democrats had their lunch meeting, but noted that their “conversations are ongoing.”
    

            He told CNN that Senate Republicans are still open to allowing an amendment vote on Democrats’ preferred, short-term funding bill if that is what it takes to get the votes to advance the House-passed GOP version. However, he noted that he needs to see “evidence” that Senate Democrats are willing to play ball.
    

            “The only thing standing between us and keeping the government open is getting the Democrats in a place where they’re willing to agree to vote on that,” Thune said.
    

This post has been updated with comments from Thune. 


            President Donald Trump’s administration is driving ahead with several controversial policies, including widespread layoffs in the federal government, despite a slew of legal challenges.
    

Today is the deadline for federal agencies to submit the first phase of their reduction in force plan while the administration is proposing a dramatic downsizing of the IRS that would result in a nearly 20% reduction of its workforce by May 15.
    

            However, a federal judge ordered the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury to rehire probationary employees fired last month, calling the effort a “sham.”


            Trump today met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House where he spoke about US tariff policies, the Ukraine ceasefire proposal and the government funding negotiations.
    

Catch up on the latest:


Trump on Ukraine: The president told reporters that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s response to the US-proposed ceasefire with Ukraine is “promising … but it wasn’t complete.” He added, “I’d love to meet with them or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast. You know, every day, people are being killed.” Putin, for his part, said he has “reservations” about a 30-day ceasefire proposal, saying it’s not clear how the situation would develop in the region of Kursk and elsewhere if a truce was implemented.
    

Tariffs: Trump said he is “not going to bend” on the sweeping 25% steel and aluminum tariffs on imports, vowing that any resulting economic disruption “won’t be very long.” As markets have reacted to the president’s tariff uncertainty with sharp losses, Trump offered a brief timeline for the economic pain: “Now, there’ll be a little disruption, but it won’t be very long,” he said. US stocks slid again today and the S&P 500 closed in correction, down 10% from its record high in February as the president threatened new tariffs on the European Union.
    

Government funding: The president placed full blame for the potential government shutdown on Democrats in Congress, telling reporters, “If there’s a shutdown, it’s only going to be because of Democrats, and they would really be taking away a lot from our country, and from the people of our country.” Separately, several Senate Democrats told CNN they expect a shutdown to be averted — potentially with enough Democrats supplying the votes to break a filibuster on the House plan.
    

Legal challenges: The administration asked the Supreme Court in a series of emergency appeals to allow Trump to move forward with plans to end birthright citizenship, elevating a fringe legal theory that several lower courts have resoundingly rejected. Separately, a federal judge ordered half a dozen federal agencies to “immediately” reinstate probationary employees fired last month as part of the administration’s effort to rapidly shrink the federal workforce. The White House described the order as “absurd and unconstitutional” and the administration said it is appealing the ruling.
    

Wartime authority: The administration is expected to invoke a sweeping wartime authority to speed up the president’s mass deportation pledge in the coming days, according to four sources familiar with the discussions. The little-known 18th-century law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, gives the president tremendous authority to target and remove undocumented immigrants, though legal experts have argued it would face an uphill battle in court.
    

Protests at Trump Tower: Nearly 100 people were arrested after protesters gathered at Trump Tower in Manhattan to denounce the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist detained by ICE over his involvement with pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University. 


Latest polls: The public’s views of the economy have dipped since December, according to a Quinnipiac University poll, which also finds registered voters divided on where they’d place responsibility in the event of a possible government shutdown.
    

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of delaying a US-proposed 30-day ceasefire in the Ukraine war after the Russian leader expressed “reservations” about the potential deal.
    

            During his nightly address Thursday, Zelensky criticized Putin’s “very predictable, very manipulative” response.
    

        “Putin, of course, is afraid to tell President Trump directly that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,” he said.
    



            Zelensky accused the Russian leader of dragging out the negotiations rather than rejecting the deal completely.
    

            He reiterated that Ukraine is “ready to work as quickly as possible, as constructively as possible” with the United States and Europe to solidify a deal.
    

            Several Senate Democrats emerged from a closed-door lunch today and told CNN they expect a government shutdown to be averted — potentially with enough Democrats supplying the votes to break a filibuster on the House plan.
    

            The Democrats, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting, predicted the most likely outcome would be that enough Senate Democrats would ultimately support advancing the House plan and allowing it to become law.
    

            Senate Democrats’ precise strategy remains unclear.
    

            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been tight-lipped about how his caucus will handle the procedural vote on whether to allow the GOP funding bill to come to the floor. That vote is expected tomorrow morning. But Schumer declared on the floor yesterday that Republicans “do not have the votes” for advancing the funding bill without Democrats.
    

            Behind the scenes, Schumer has been privately speaking to Democrats about whether they’ll vote to advance the House bill, according to multiple people familiar with those conversations.
    

            Leaving the lunch meeting, Sen. Martin Heinrich said that he does “fully respect” his colleagues who end up voting to advance the House-passed bill. Heinrich himself, however, announced earlier today that he will oppose the package.
    

            A number of Senate Democrats argued today that they’re not willing to cede power to President Donald Trump in order to keep the government open past Friday night, warning that the GOP-led bill to extend funding through September would dilute Congress’ constitutional authority and empower the White House even further.
    

Sen. Cory Booker told CNN’s Manu Raju that passing a bill now and opening a door to Trump having more influence over the next fiscal year negotiations sends the message: “Let’s just give up even more of our constitutional authority, because, hey, he can do a lot worse later on.” The New Jersey senator said it would be giving in “to someone who’s already showing that he’s reckless and willing to do a lot of destruction.”
    

            Booker said it would be “horrible” if the government shuts down and lamented that the option to avert a shutdown would be to give Trump “license to destroy the government that (he’s) already starting to destroy,” pointing to recent cuts at the Department of Education.
    

Sen. Jeff Merkley said “it would be a Republican shutdown” if a funding bill isn’t passed before the late Friday deadline, because Democrats would support opening up the government “immediately” through bipartisan negotiations.
    

Sen. Mark Warner, who has announced that he would join his Democratic colleagues who plan on blocking a GOP-led bill from advancing, said Trump and Musk control “the whole show,” and that he hopes “some of our Republican friends would be willing to say, ‘no, let’s make sure we honor the Constitution and have Congress be an active participant,’” when pressed on a path forward.
    

            US President Donald Trump said today that he still thinks that US will annex Greenland.
    

        “I think it will happen,” he said in response to a question from a journalist in the Oval Office about his vision to annex the territory. “We need that for international security.”
    



            NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who was present in the room for a meeting with Trump, did not comment directly on Trump’s statement, saying he did not “want to drag NATO” into the issue.
    

            However, he did acknowledge the importance of securing the Arctic region. “We know things are changing there, and we have to be there.”
    

            The United States has put forward a new proposal that would secure the release of a handful of living hostages held in Gaza in exchange for a month-long extension of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, a source familiar with the negotiations said.
    

            The exact numbers of living and dead hostages to be released by Hamas during the extended ceasefire as well as the number of Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel remained the subject of negotiations, the source said.
    

            Under the US proposal, which was presented this week in Qatar by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Israel would also lift its blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been ongoing for nearly two weeks.
    

            The ceasefire extension would run until the end of Passover, extending the pause in fighting and renewing the entry of humanitarian aid through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday.
    

            When asked about the proposal, a State Department spokesperson said they would not comment on ongoing negotiations. Asked for comment on reports of progress in the negotiations, Hamas spokesman Basem Naim said: “Things are at a standstill.” The Israeli Prime Minister’s office did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    

On hostages: The latest US proposal marked a reduction from its previous proposal in the number of hostages to be released by Hamas during the same time period, drawing swift concern from the families of the hostages.
    

            “The publications about the outline for the return of only a few hostages raise serious concerns among the families of the hostages that their loved ones will be left in captivity for a long and unknown period,” the Hostages and Missing Families’ Forum said in a statement. “We demand a comprehensive and immediate agreement that will return all 59 hostages in one fell swoop and leave no one behind.”
    

            Of the 59 hostages still being held in Gaza, fewer than half are still believed to be alive.
    

CNN’s Jennifer Hasler contributed reporting to this post.


            President Donald Trump once again touted what he called his “great relationship” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte today, suggesting he’d be open to reestablishing talks with the North Korea leader.
    

            Asked if he plans to reestablish the cordial relationship he enjoyed during his first term with North Korea’s leader, Trump told reporters:
    

         “Well, I would. I had a great relationship with Kim Jong and North Korea.”He added, “We went to Singapore, where we met, we went to Vietnam, we met, we got along really good. We had a very good relationship, and we still do.”
    



            The president acknowledged that his initial relationship with Kim “started off very rough,” in a nod to his own 2017 promise of “fire and fury,” if North Korea continued to issue military threats against US territory, admitting initially, “the rhetoric was extremely tough. It was a little bit dangerous.”
    

            But he said that the North Korean leader told him his relationship with his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, was even frostier, “and he wouldn’t meet with Obama, wouldn’t take his calls.”
    

            “And so, I have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, and we’ll see what happens,” Trump added.
    

            New York’s Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul will visit the White House on Friday morning to discuss a pipeline, President Donald Trump said on Thursday.
    

            “The governor is coming in, governor of New York, Kathy Hochul, who’s a very nice woman. She’s coming in tomorrow morning at nine o’clock to meet me,” the president said while meeting with the secretary general of NATO in the Oval Office.
    

            The pipeline, which the president has discussed before, is a proposed expansion of an existing gas pipeline that would bring it into New York. It had previously been blocked by officials due to environmental concerns.

            NATO members are lagging behind Russia and China when it comes to producing weaponry, the military alliance’s chief said today at the White House.
    

        “We need to produce more weaponry. We are not doing enough. Not in the US, not in Europe,” Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters while sitting beside President Donald Trump at the Oval Office. “We are lagging behind when you compare to the Russians and the Chinese.”
    



            The United States has a “strong” defense industry, but more needs to be done to “ramp up” production, he added.
    

            President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s response to the US-proposed ceasefire with Ukraine is “promising… but it wasn’t complete.”
    

            “He put out a very promising statement, but it wasn’t complete,” the president said in the Oval Office while meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. “I’d love to meet with them or talk to him, but we have to get it over with fast. You know, every day, people are being killed.”
    

            Trump’s comments come as the US works to broker a ceasefire, which Putin said Russia supports in theory. But the Russian president said there are many things that still need to be discussed before a deal is agreed to, saying he has “reservations” at his news conference earlier Thursday.
    

            Trump said that the US has been discussing with the Ukrainians what land would be kept and lost in any final deal.
    

            “We’ve been discussing with Ukraine land, and pieces of land, that would be kept and lost, and all of the other elements of a final agreement,” Trump said. “So a lot of the details of a final agreement have actually been discussed.”
    

            Trump added that if Russia does not agree to the ceasefire, it will be a “very disappointing moment for the world.”
    

            “Now we’re going to see whether or not Russia is there, and if they’re not, it’ll be a very disappointing moment for the world,” the president said.
    

            Asked if he has “leverage” the US can place on Putin, such as sanctions, the president said he has leverage but does not want to talk about it.
    

            “I do have leverage, but I don’t want to talk about leverage now, because right now we’re talking to them, and based on the statements he made today, they were pretty positive I think,” Trump added.
    

            President Donald Trump will head to the Department of Justice on Friday to outline his vision on crime and immigration, promising to discuss “the complete gambit” on topics related to safety in his remarks.
    

        “All I’m going to do is set out my vision. It’s going to be their vision, really, but it’s my ideas,” Trump said today, when asked about his expected remarks at the DOJ tomorrow.
    



            The president was taking questions from reporters before holding a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office on Thursday.
    

            “We don’t want to have crime in the streets. We don’t want to have people pushed into subways and killed,” Trump said. “We want to have justice and we want to have safety in our cities as well as our communities,” he added.
    

            Trump said he will also cover immigration and border security in his remarks. Earlier today, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the speech will outline the Trump administration’s strategy for “restoring law and order.”


            Trump’s visit will further highlight his hands-on approach to the Justice Department, where he has installed loyalists while removing numerous officials perceived as disloyal.
    

            Canada has requested consultation with the World Trade Organization (WTO) over US tariffs on steel and aluminum, the WTO said in a statement on Thursday.
    

            Canada claims the tariffs “are inconsistent with US obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994,” the WTO statement further said.
    

            Consultation “formally initiates a dispute in the WTO,” it added.
    

What is WTO?: The organization is the center of the global trading system made up of and governed by member nations. The WTO administers the network of international trade rules currently in place. It serves as a place to negotiate changes to existing agreements and, when issues come up, for member countries to mediate any disputes.
    

            Yesterday, Canadian Minister of Export Mary Ng said in a statement posted on X that the tariffs “violate the United States’ obligations under both the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement.”
    

            This comes ahead of a Thursday meeting between Canada’s Minister of Finance Dominic LeBlanc and US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick to discuss the USMCA agreement.
    

            President Donald Trump placed full blame for the potential of a looming government shutdown on Democrats in Congress Thursday, telling reporters at the White House, “If there’s a shutdown, it’s only going to be because of Democrats, and they would really be taking away a lot from our country, and from the people of our country.”
    

        “If they do a shutdown and ultimately that might lead to very, very high taxes, because we’re talking about a shutdown, we’re talking about getting to work immediately on the greatest tax bill ever passed,” Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office. “If we don’t open, the Democrats are stopping all of these good things that we’re providing, we’re providing the greatest package of benefits that this country has ever provided, and the biggest part of that is going to be tax cuts for the middle class, and for businesses, small businesses, employers, people that hire people and jobs.”
    



            In remarks from the Senate floor Wednesday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats have the votes to block the House-passed GOP spending bill, calling on Senate Republicans to cut a deal with Democrats on a short-term spending bill instead while they continue negotiating full-year appropriations.
    

        “If it shuts down, it’s not the Republicans’ fault — you know, we passed a bill where we had an incredible Republican vote, we only had one negative vote, a grandstander,” Trump said Thursday, in an apparent reference to Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who voted against the government funding bill and has inspired the ire of the president on social media.
    



            The president left the door open to negotiating directly with Democrats, telling a reporter, “If they need me, I’m there, 100%.”
    

            And he hinted that he believed some Democrats would likely join Republicans in voting for the House-passed continuing resolution.
    

            President Donald Trump indicated Thursday that he is “not going to bend” on the sweeping 25% steel and aluminum tariffs on imports into the country, vowing that any resulting economic disruption “won’t be very long.”
    

            “No, I’m not going to bend at all aluminum or steel or cars. We’re not going to bend. We’ve been ripped off as a country for many, many years,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
    

            As markets have reacted to the president’s tariff uncertainty with sharp losses, Trump offered a brief timeline for the economic pain: “Now, there’ll be a little disruption, but it won’t be very long,” he said.
    

            Those comments come after the president threatened to “shortly place a 200% tariff” on alcoholic beverages coming into the US, prompting major concerns from the spirits industry.
    

            Trump continued to double down on his desire to make Canada the 51st state, as he claimed the US “(doesn’t) need their cars, we don’t need their energy, we don’t need their lumber, we don’t need anything that they give, we do it because we want to be helpful.”
    

            According to the National Association of Home Builders, “The U.S. currently imports roughly 30% of the softwood lumber the nation uses because there is not enough domestic capacity to meet demand.” And Canada’s energy system is significantly interconnected with the US grid.
    

            Trump downplayed concerns that the tariff tit-for-tat would hurt American small businesses. “They’re going to be so much richer than they are right now,” he said.
    

            Elon Musk made his first known visit to the National Security Agency and US Cyber Command in Fort Meade, Maryland, on Wednesday,  according to a statement from an NSA spokesperson.
    

            Musk came “in his capacity as Special Advisor to the President of the United States,” according to the statement.
    

        “NSA and CYBERCOM are focused on the President, SECDEF and DNI’s priorities; meetings with key advisors ensure we are aligned,” the statement said.
    



            The visit came just a day before today’s deadline for federal agencies to identify widespread cuts to workforce, an effort that Musk’s DOGE has been intimately involved in — but one which so far appears to have been largely left to agency heads in the major national security agencies.
    

            A federal judge has ordered half a dozen federal agencies to “immediately” reinstate probationary employees fired last month as part of the Trump administration’s effort to rapidly shrink the federal workforce.
    

            The preliminary injunction issued from the bench by US District Judge William Alsup requires the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury to rehire the employees. The judge said that he might extend the order to cover other federal agencies at a later time.
    

            Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said he was making the ruling because he believes the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.
    

        “The court finds that Office of Personnel Management did direct all agencies to terminate probationary employees with the exception of mission critical employees,” he said, rejecting arguments from the Justice Department that OPM merely issued “guidance” to the agencies that then led to the firings.
    



            The Trump administration said that it is appealing the ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.

            After a series of tit-for-tat tariff moves between the US and Canada this week, top officials from the two countries are meeting today to discuss the trade war and other bilateral issues.
    

            Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with his Canadian counterpart, Mélanie Joly, at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Quebec.
    

            In Washington, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick will meet with Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc at 4 p.m. ET, Ford’s spokesperson told CNN. They are expected to discuss the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) ahead of a reciprocal tariff deadline on April 2.
    

What is the USMCA? The agreement is a free trade treaty that US President Donald Trump negotiated, signed in 2018, that he has since touted as “the best trade deal ever made.”
    

            Ford is an important attendee at the talks, as Ontario exports electricity to New York, Michigan and Minnesota. He threatened a 25% surcharge on electricity if Trump were to enact a 50% tariff on aluminum and steel from Canada. Trump backed down as a result. But a 25% tariff on all US imports of the metals remains in place.
    

            Those tariffs on steel and aluminum could be felt by Americans in the form of price hikes. The metals are used in cans for food, beer and soda and cars, and much of it is imported.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin said during his Thursday news conference that he has “reservations” about a 30-day ceasefire proposal in the Ukraine war, saying it’s not clear how the situation would develop in the region of Kursk and elsewhere if a ceasefire was implemented.
    

            Putin lauded the US idea as “great and correct” and said Russia supports it in theory, but there are many things that still need to be discussed before a deal is agreed to.
    

            Putin went on to raise many questions about a potential ceasefire, including how it would be verified. He also said the ceasefire must “be aimed at a long-lasting peace and it must look at the root causes of the crisis.”
    

            It’s not the first time Putin has urged eliminating what he calls the “root causes” of the war, and the Kremlin has previously claimed the current Ukrainian government is part of the root cause.
    

            He also said “maybe” he would call US President Donald Trump. But Putin and Trump are not expected to speak to each other on Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN.
    

War in key region: Russian forces have recaptured Sudzha, the largest town that Ukraine once occupied in the Kursk region, according to Moscow, threatening Kyiv’s sole territorial bargaining chip amid pressure to negotiate an end to the war.
    

Meeting with Lukashenko: Putin and Belarus’ leader Alexander Lukashenko met in Moscow today as well. Lukashenko said the United States “doesn’t have a plan” for Ukraine and is currently “testing the waters” with its ceasefire proposal.
    

            Lukashenko, Putin’s closest international ally, said there was no rush to reach an agreement, adding there were still “so many fences and rubbish in all of this.”
    

            “I simply advise you: Don’t fall for Donald’s tricks,” he added, referring to Trump.

            A new lawsuit from Democratic attorneys general in 20 states and the District of Columbia alleges this week’s mass layoffs at the Department of Education are gutting the agency as a way to implement an unlawful plan by President Donald Trump to dismantle the department.
    

            The states accuse the administration of “effectively nullifying” mandates by Congress that require the department to carry out certain functions.
    

        “Here, where Congress has created the Department of Education, the Executive and his agencies cannot incapacitate it, absent Congressional action that directs them to do so,” the lawsuit said.
    



            On Tuesday, the administration announced that it was cutting nearly half of the Department’s staff, with roughly 1,300 employees notified this week that they would be terminated in 90 days.
    

            The attorneys general say that with the layoffs, the administration is severely handicapping Department of Education offices created explicitly by Congress, including the Office of Civil Rights, which is losing the majority of its staff, according to the complaint.
    

            The lawsuit highlighted other offices that they work closely with on education issues that were being “effectively eliminated” with the so-called Reduction in Force. The effects are already being felt, the attorneys general said, alleging that an online system for grant distribution was inaccessible in the wake of the RIF announcement.
    

            The Department of Education did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            The Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency are proposing a dramatic downsizing of the Internal Revenue Service that would result in a nearly 20% reduction of its workforce by May 15 — one month after Tax Day in the United States.
    

            The details of the IRS proposal have been laid out in an email from DOGE and will be discussed at a meeting among agency leadership Thursday morning, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. The proposal has not been made public.
    

            The latest round of layoffs would terminate nearly 6,800 employees — on top of about 6,700 probationary employees who have already been fired and 4,700 employees who took the “voluntary buyout” known as the “Fork in the Road” program from the Trump administration.
    

Possible impacts: Echoing concerns sounded by experts and other employees, the source says these cuts could impact the amount of revenue the IRS brings in and that could ripple through the federal government as IRS funds nearly all government operations. While April 15 is the deadline for tax returns to be filed, the agency processes tax returns year-round.
    

        “Depending upon how we effectuate these cuts, it could dramatically reduce revenue, dramatically reduce customer service,” the source said, adding that the cuts could also impact voluntary tax compliance.
    



            “If we are not auditing much, it impacts people’s willingness to file honestly in the first place,” the source said.
    

            President Donald Trump has ordered agencies across the federal government to turn in layoff plans — known as reduction in force, or RIF — by Thursday.
    

            Several senior Senate Republicans insisted that their Democratic colleagues will eventually give in and help advance the House-passed funding bill before Friday’s shutdown deadline.
    

            “I think … they’ll cave,” Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. “I mean, you’re talking about people who have been railing against Elon Musk and the Trump administration over reductions in force of the federal employees, and now they basically want to put all of them out of work by shutting down the government. So that seems to be, I don’t know how you reconcile those two positions,” he added.
    

        He later said, “I think cooler heads will prevail, and I don’t see a see a shutdown. That’s certainly my hope.”
    



South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham agreed. “It’ll work out between now and Friday. Nobody wins these things, so, you know, live to fight another day,” he told CNN.
    

What Democrats are saying: Separately, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said that he is “not sure at this point” if an amendment vote on a one-month stopgap bill would be enough to peel off some Democrats to vote to advance the House-passed package and avert a government shutdown.
    

            “There are many of us who believe that if we’re going to resolve this and do it in a bipartisan fashion, now is the moment to seize that opportunity,” he said.
    

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said that he would fight the House-passed version,  saying that Democrats can’t give in on this funding bill.
    

            “What the Republicans are doing is not a CR; it’s a license to destroy,” he argued.
    

            “I cannot support giving them a license to destroy nor that surrenders or capitulates what I swore an oath to do, which is uphold the Constitution,” he added.
    

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal also dodged when asked if Democrats could take the fall. “Nobody wants a shutdown, and there’s a clear path to avoiding it. Let’s vote on April 11. Democrats are united in favor of it,” he said.
    

            The Trump administration is expected to invoke a sweeping wartime authority to speed up the president’s mass deportation pledge in the coming days, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.
    

            The little-known 18th-century law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, gives the president tremendous authority to target and remove undocumented immigrants, though legal experts have argued it would face an uphill battle in court.
    

CNN previously reported that the authority was being widely discussed at several agencies as administration officials prepared to implement the law. The primary target remains Tren de Aragua (TDA) , a Venezuelan organized crime group that is now operating in the United States and other countries and was recently designated as a foreign terrorist organization.
    

            At the start of his term, Trump had ordered his administration to designate TDA as a foreign terrorist organization and use the measure to remove those identified as members.
    

            The announcement, which could come as soon as Friday, has been a moving target as officials finalize the details. The move would likely pave the way for quicker removals of certain immigrants.
    

            CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.
    

More about the law: It’s designed to be invoked if the US is at war with another country, or a foreign nation has invaded the US or threatened to do so. Legal experts say it would be difficult for Trump to use the act when the US isn’t being attacked by a foreign government, even if the administration does cite threats from gangs or cartels.
    

            The Alien Enemies Act has been invoked three times in US history — all during war — according to the Brennan Center. During World Wars I and II, it was used to justify detentions and expulsions of German, Austro-Hungarian, Italian and Japanese immigrants. The law played a role in the infamous US policy of Japanese internment during World War II, according to the nonpartisan law and policy institute.
    

            President Donald Trump is set to visit the Justice Department on Friday, where he will discuss his administration’s strategy for “restoring law and order,” the White House tells CNN.
    

        “President Trump will visit the Department of Justice to give remarks on restoring law and order, removing violent criminals from our communities, and ending the weaponization of justice against Americans for their political leanings. President Trump’s historic visit to the Department of Justice will signify another promise made and kept,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN.
    



            Trump’s visit will further highlight his hands-on approach to the Justice Department, where he has installed loyalists while removing numerous officials perceived as disloyal.
    

            The president had initially planned to visit the Justice Department last month, but the trip was postponed.
    

            Axios was first to report Trump’s visit for Friday.
    

            The US spirits industry is calling for calm and no tariffs as the trade war between the United States and Europe heats up and President Donald Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European alcohol.
    

        “We want toasts not tariffs,” Chris Swonger, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said in a statement on Thursday.
    



            Swonger argued the US-EU spirits industry is the “model for fair and reciprocal trade, having zero-for-zero tariffs since 1997.”
    

            However, the EU responded to Trump’s 25% tariff on steel and aluminum that kicked in on Wednesday by announcing plans to tariff a range of US products, including American whiskey.
    

            Trump fired back on Thursday by saying that unless that tariff is removed, he will put a 200% tariff on European alcohol.
    

        “We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector,” Swonger said, noting that the US spirits sector supports 1.7 million jobs across production, distribution, hospitality and retail.
    



            Venezuela has agreed to resume flights picking up and bringing home their own citizens who entered the US illegally, according to Ric Grenell, President Donald Trump’s envoy for special missions.
    

            “I am pleased to announce that Venezuela has agreed to resume flights to pick up their citizens who broke U.S. Immigration Laws and entered the U.S. illegally,” he wrote in a social media post on Thursday. “The flights will resume Friday,” Grenell added.
    

            In response to Trump’s decision to revoke Chevron’s operating license in Venezuela, the South American country had announced earlier this week it would stop accepting deportees from the US.
    

Trump administrations crackdown: In February, a plane carrying 177 Venezuelan migrants, who were held in Guantanamo Bay after being deported from the US, were flown back to Venezuela.
    

            Hundreds of migrants were sent to Guantanamo Bay as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on migration, but they have since been mostly flown elsewhere after questions were raised over the legality of such an initiative. The base on Cuba is notorious for holding prisoners of the US-led “war on terror.”
    

            The Department of Homeland Security alleged that Venezuelan migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay have ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, a criminal network that started in a Venezuelan prison. Of the deportees, 126 people had criminal charges or convictions, including 80 allegedly affiliated with Tren de Aragua, a DHS spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that 51 had no criminal record.

            The White House has withdrawn its nomination of Dr. Dave Weldon to serve as the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two Trump administration officials familiar with the decision told CNN.
    

            The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee canceled Weldon’s nomination hearing on Thursday, following the withdrawal. In the past, the CDC director has been appointed to lead the office. This was to be the first time the Senate has had a chance to vote on the nomination to lead the agency.
    

            Trump officials had privately voiced concerns with Weldon’s recent comments expressing skepticism about vaccines. Even US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long history of questioning vaccines, had concerns, the sources said.
    

            Democratic Sen. Patty Murray told CNN Weldon’s “stance on immunizations is really dangerous at this time for our country,” while Republican Sen. Susan Collins said she “had reservations about the nominee, but I wanted to give him the opportunity to answer questions in a public forum.”
    

Axios first reported on the White House’s decision to withdraw Weldon’s nomination.
    

What Weldon says: In a lengthy statement obtained by CBS News, Weldon described receiving a phone call from the White House 12 hours before the Senate committee hearing to inform him that the nomination had been pulled. Weldon said in the statement that Kennedy was “very upset” about the change and that his “big sin” was having “the temerity to take on the CDC” on childhood vaccine safety as a congressman. He said he’s viewed negatively by the pharmaceutical industry and others.
    

            “I really wanted to try to make the CDC a better more respected agency and killing my nomination may have the opposite effect. Distrust may worsen,” Weldon said.

            Social Security beneficiaries will no longer be able to change their bank account information through the agency’s telephone service, in an effort to reduce fraud, the Social Security Administration announced on Wednesday.
    

            About 40% of Social Security direct deposit fraud stems from calls to Social Security to change bank information, the agency said, noting that the current protocol of asking identifying questions is no longer sufficient.
    

            Going forward, beneficiaries will have to change their bank accounts through the “my Social Security” online service, which uses two-factor authentication, or visit a local Social Security office. These methods are what most major banks use, the agency noted.
    

            The new rule will take effect on March 29.
    

            The move comes after the Washington Post reported that the agency was considering ending phone service but then reversed those plans after the story’s publication. The agency said that report was inaccurate.
    

Claims of fraud: Social Security has ramped up its focus on fraud after Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency descended on the agency. Musk has repeatedly claimed that the program is rife with fraud, sparking a firestorm in a Fox Business interview Monday when he questioned spending on entitlement programs.
    

            President Donald Trump has also raised questions about fraud in Social Security, leading to concerns about his oft-stated commitment to protecting benefits. Trump and Musk have seeded the idea — which is not backed up by known facts — that millions of dead people are collecting payments.
    

            The agency made nearly $72 billion in improper payments between fiscal year 2015 and 2022, or less than 1% of total benefits paid during that period, according to Social Security’s inspector general.
    

            The agency is in the midst of a massive reorganization to comply with the Trump administration’s directive to shrink the federal government. It is seeking to reduce staffing by 7,000 people, or about 12% of its workforce, which have raised fears of disruptions in services and benefit payments.
    

            United States special envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow on Thursday, a source familiar with the situation told CNN.
    

            Russian state news agency TASS reported earlier Thursday that Witkoff’s plane has landed at Vnukovo International Airport in the Russian capital, citing data from Flightradar 24.
    

            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that Moscow is expected to be briefed by US officials on an American ceasefire proposal accepted by Ukraine on Tuesday. The US has said it now has to see if Russia will agree to that same deal.


On the ground in Ukraine: The country has just lost a major bargaining chip, with Moscow saying Russian forces have taken Sudzha, the largest town that Ukraine once occupied in the Kursk region.
    

            The US-based conflict monitor the institute for the Study of War (ISW) said footage from the ground indicated that Russian forces had seized Sudzha and advanced to southern Zaoleshenka, a settlement just northwest of Sudzha.
    

            Its recapture would represent a major symbolic victory for Russia. Although Sudzha is a small town, with a population of about 5,000 people before Ukraine’s incursion, it was one of the only populated towns still held by Ukraine.
    

From CNN’s Anna Chernova and Lauren Kent contributed reporting. This post has been updated with more reporting on Witkoff’s arrival to Moscow. 


            President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to impose a massive tariff on European alcohol in response to the European Union’s retaliation against his steel and aluminum tariffs — a tit-for-tat escalation of a trade war that could easily get out of hand.
    

            In a post on Truth Social, Trump said his administration would impose a 200% tariff on alcoholic beverages from the EU unless it rescinds the 50% tariff the European government imposed Wednesday on US whiskey.
    

        “If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” Trump said. “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.”
    



            Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office that he would respond to the EU’s retaliatory tariffs.
    

            On Thursday, Trump called the EU “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World, which was formed for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the United States.”
    

            He called the retaliatory tariff it imposed on US bourbon “nasty.”
    

            Concerns about the nation’s economy have grown in the first months of President Donald Trump’s return to office, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, as few Americans see his policies as having helped economic conditions and 55% say his cuts to federal programs will do economic harm.
    

            Americans split evenly over whether economic conditions a year from now will be good (49%) or poor (51%), but the share saying they expect the economy to be in bad shape a year from now is up 7 points since January, just before Trump took office.
    

            Jitters on Wall Street about Trump’s economic policies have sent the stock market into a decline, and Trump has given mixed messages on whether he believes it’s possible the economy is headed into a recession.
    

            About half of the public, 51%, say they think Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions and just 28% that they have improved things. Another 21% say they’ve had no effect on the economy.

            Russian presidential aide Yuriy Ushakov said Thursday that Moscow doesn’t want a temporary ceasefire, as it would give respite to the Ukrainian army.
    

            The Kremlin has previously ruled out a temporary truce, but this is the first time a senior Russian official has outlined that position since the United States and Ukraine held talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week, in which Ukraine accepted proposals for a 30-day US-backed ceasefire covering the entire frontline.
    

            “I can say that I have recently been in fairly regular telephone contact with (US national security adviser) Michael Waltz,” the Kremlin aide said in an interview with Russian state media, adding that he spoke with Waltz on Wednesday about the US-Ukraine negotiations.
    

        “I of course commented on the agreements reached on the temporary ceasefire and outlined our position that this is nothing more than a temporary respite for the Ukrainian military and nothing more,” Ushakov said. “We believe that our goal is a long-term peaceful settlement. That is what we are striving for. Peaceful settlement.”
    



            “The Americans and we think that there can be no talk about NATO in the context of the Ukrainian settlement and in the context of Ukraine’s future,” Ushakov also claimed.
    

            CNN has asked the White House and State Department for comment.
    

            Russia has previously said it would reject NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine. When US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was asked Wednesday about the possibility of European troops acting as peacekeepers, the top US diplomat responded: “There’s different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground.”
    

Negotiations: His remarks come as the Kremlin confirmed on Thursday that US negotiators will travel to Russia and are expected to take part in Ukraine war peace talks with Russian counterparts.
    

            “Indeed, negotiators are on their way, and contacts are planned,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said during a news briefing Thursday. He declined to provide further details on the participants, saying, “We will share the details with you later.”
    

            Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday morning that the plane carrying US special envoy Steven Witkoff had landed in Moscow, citing data from the Flightradar 24 tracking service.
    

            As a part of the Trump administration’s sweeping overhaul of federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management previously issued a memo to agency leaders with guidance on how to conduct their reductions in force, known as RIFs, and the reorganizations plans.
    

            The memo outlined ways for agencies to reduce their workforces, including conducting “a significant reduction” in the number of federal workers by eliminating positions that are not needed and reducing federal property holdings and budget, as well as providing better service to Americans and increasing productivity, according to the memo.
    

            It also outlined multiple phases to laying off large numbers of staff members.
    

            The deadline for submitting the first phase of the plans, which should include implementation timetables, is today.
    

First phase: The information requested includes submitting lists of agency divisions and employees performing functions not mandated by law or regulation who are not considered essential employees during government shutdowns.
    

            The plans should also include lists of all jobs categorized as essential, of agency divisions that provide direct service to Americans and of any statutes that establish the agency, as well as the tools the agencies plan to use to reduce their staffs, according to the memo.
    

            Plus, it said agencies should provide suggestions for how to engage Congress to gain agreement on major restructuring efforts and on moving funds between accounts.
    

Read the full memo here.


            House Speaker Mike Johnson is ratcheting up the blame game as he continues to frame Senate Democrats as the culprit if there is a government shutdown Friday at midnight.
    

        “The House has done its job and passed a clean CR to fund the federal government,” he posted Wednesday on X. “If Senate Democrats block an up-or-down vote on this, then it’s crystal clear: THEY want to shut down the government. Period. Full stop.”
    



            After the House passed its stopgap spending bill, Johnson on Tuesday argued that it’s now Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s responsibility to “determine whether he wants to fund the government and do the responsible thing or whether he wants to shut the government down.”
    

            Schumer said Wednesday that Democrats have the votes to block the House-passed GOP spending bill and called on Senate Republicans to cut a deal with Democrats on a short-term spending bill instead, while they continue negotiating full year appropriations.
